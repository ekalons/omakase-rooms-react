                    <ul className="EtiquetteUL">
                        <li><p><strong>Be early: </strong>Being on time is considered late, get there 10 minutes early</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Avoid perfume or cologne: </strong>The perfume can mask the scent of the food and affect your experience, as well as the experience of those around you</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>There are no strict dress codes: </strong>Smart casual is generally appropriate, but it could vary</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Don't be loud: </strong>Omakase rooms are generally quiet places, so be sure to put your phone in silent mode and avoid loud talking if you are bringing someone</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Put your phone away: </strong>The small counter is only for food and it is considered rude to have the phone taking space</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Dining</h2>
                    <ul className="EtiquetteUL">
                        <li><p><strong>Eat right away: </strong>The temperature of the food is fundamental to the flavor, so skip the pictures and eat the food as soon as the chef hands it to you</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Eat it in one bite: </strong>Balance is lost if you eat things in multiple bites</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Careful with the soy sauce: </strong>Don't drown the nigiri/rolls in soy sauce, just lightly dip it (fish side down). After dipping, don't shake the nigiri/rolls, it can be considered rude</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Use ginger to cleanse the palate: </strong>Ginger should only be eaten by itself and between different kinds of nigiri/rolls. It's a way to reset and cleanse your palate between different tastes</p></li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Manners</h2>
                    <ul className="EtiquetteUL">
                        <li><p><strong>It's ok to use your hands: </strong>Both chopsticks and hands are ok, and some chefs will even encourage you to grab the food using your hands</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Ask before taking photos: </strong>Some chefs don't like photos, because they find them distracting, so just ask before taking one</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Tips</h2>
